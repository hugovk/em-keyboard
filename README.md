**Emoji your friends and colleagues from the comfort of your own
terminal.**

**em** is a nifty command-line utility for referencing emoji characters
by name. Provide the names of a few emoji, and those lucky chosen emojis
will be displayed in your terminal, then copied to your clipboard.
Automagically.

Emoji can be also searched by both categories and aspects.

## Example Usage

Let's serve some delicious cake:

```console
$ em sparkles shortcake sparkles
Copied! ✨🍰✨
```

Let's skip the copying (for scripts):

```console
$ em 'chocolate bar' --no-copy
🍫
```

Let's find some emoji, by color:

```console
$ em -s red
🥵  hot_face
👹  ogre
👺  goblin
🚗  automobile
🎴  flower_playing_cards
❌  cross_mark
```

## Installation

At this time, **em** requires Python and pip:

```sh
python3 -m pip install em-keyboard
```

That's it!

## Tests

If you wanna develop, you might want to write and run tests:

```sh
python3 -m pip install tox
tox
```

## Have fun!

✨🍰✨
